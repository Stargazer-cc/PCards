## FAQ

**Q: Why aren't my cards displaying properly?**  
A: Ensure all required fields are filled in. Music cards need `title`, `artist`, `year`, and `description`; Book cards need `title`, `author`, `year`, and `description`; Movie/TV/Anime cards need `title`, `director`, `year`, and `description`.

**Q: How can I use Obsidian internal links in cards?**  
A: For the `url` field, you can use the `obsidian://` protocol to link to internal notes; for the `cover` field, you can use the `![[image name]]` format to reference images in your vault.

**Q: How do I refresh the card index?**  
A: Click the "Refresh Index" button in the Cards Gallery view. The plugin will scan all note files and update the card index.

**Q: Can I customize card styles?**  
A: You can customize text colors in the plugin settings, or further customize styles using CSS snippets.

**Q: How can I bulk import cards?**  
A: The plugin doesn't directly support bulk import, but you can prepare a Markdown file with multiple card code blocks and import it into Obsidian.

**Q: How do I add custom metadata fields?**  
A: In the Quick Note view, all media card types (movie, book, music, TV, anime) provide a custom metadata section where you can add any number of field names and values. You can also manually add them when writing cards using the `meta.field_name: field_value` format.
